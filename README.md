# Firebase Asynchronous getUser() Promise Handling Error

This repository demonstrates a common error in Firebase Cloud Functions related to asynchronous operations and improper promise handling.  The `bug.js` file contains code that attempts to access user data from `admin.auth().getUser()` before the promise has resolved, leading to undefined values and errors. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version that uses `async/await` to ensure proper asynchronous handling and error management.  This example showcases how to correctly handle asynchronous operations in Firebase functions to prevent common errors and enhance application reliability.
