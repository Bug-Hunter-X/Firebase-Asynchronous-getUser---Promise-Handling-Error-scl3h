The solution involves using `async/await` to ensure that the `admin.auth().getUser()` promise resolves before attempting to access its data.  This approach makes the asynchronous code easier to read and reason about, reducing the likelihood of such errors.  Additionally, error handling is incorporated to gracefully manage situations where the user might not be found.

```javascript
async function handleAuth(uid) {
  try {
    const user = await admin.auth().getUser(uid);
    console.log('User UID:', user.uid);
    //Further operations with the user data
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching user:', error);
    //Handle the error appropriately
  }
}
```
